<h1> 1 Introduction </h1> 

This document is a user manual for version 1.0 of the XCombat visualisation system.
XCombat is an X Windows program for displaying and animating the data output from
the PACAUS and SWARMM systems. Specifically, XCombat is designed to display
an air to air combat scenario involving multiple aircraft and missiles.

The system enables the user to view the simulation from a number of different
views, including outside world views, tracking a particular aircraft
and from inside the cockpit of an aircraft. 

In addition XCombat also provides
facilities to display aircraft and missile traces, radar information, 
electronic warfare data, waypoints, flares, aircraft data 
such as speed and altitude, a head up display, and the ability to
step through the simulation forwards and backwards, transform the scene
in various ways, scale the size of the aircraft, and to save a user's settings

<h2> 1.1 Starting XCombat </h2> 
The XCombat system can be started on the UNIX command line as follows:
<pre>
    xcombat pac.his
</pre>
The file pac.his was specified above, but any file that is a valid
PACAUS or SWARMM graphics history file may be specified.

After the file is loaded, the XCombat window will appear on the screen
which will enabling the user to start viewing the run.

<h2> 1.2 Command Line Arguments </h2> 
XCombat has many command line arguments that enable the user to 
modify how the program operates. 

The command line arguments are 
divided into XCombat specific arguments and those which apply
to X Windows (Xt based) programs such as XCombat. Command line
arguments may be specified as follows:
<pre>
    xcombat -arg1 -arg2 pac.his
</pre>

<h3> 1.2.1 Standard XCombat Command Line Arguments </h3>
<pre>
Usage: xcombat [-runtime] [-port portnumber]
       [-basicmodels] [-time start_time] [-settings settingsfile] [-path pathname]
       [-view WORLDVIEW|VIEWPOINT|COCKPIT|SPOTTER] filename
</pre>
<center>
<table class="table table-striped">
<tr> <th> Flag </th> <th> Description </th> </tr> 
<tr> <td>-runtime</td> <td>Sets up xcombat in runtime mode with PACAUS</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>-port</td> <td>Specify a socket port eg: xcombat -runtime -port 123</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>-basicmodels</td> <td>Defaults to basic aircraft models</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>-time</td> <td>Specify at what time (in seconds) the run should start</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>-settings</td> <td>Specify a valid settings file to load</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>-view</td> <td>Specify WORLDVIEW, VIEWPOINT, SPOTTER, or COCKPIT</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>filename</td> <td>A valid pac.his file - not required in runtime mode</td> </tr>
</table>
</center>

<h3> 1.2.2 X Toolkit Command Line Arguments </h3>
Since XCombat is an OSF/Motif based program it automatically accepts all the
standard X Toolkit Intrinsics command line options. Some of the most common 
and useful options are listed in the table below.
<p>
<center>
<table class="table table-striped"> 
<tr> <th> Flag </th> <th> Description </th> </tr> 
<tr>
<td>-geometry</td>
<td>Specify the size and the position of the window on screen. <br> 
    Geometry is specified as WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y <br> 
    For example xcombat -geometry 1024x768+100+200 . </td>
</tr>
<tr> <td>-bg</td> <td>Sets the background colour. Eg: xcombat -bg red4 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>-background</td> <td>Same as -bg</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>-fg</td> <td>Sets the foreground colour</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>-foreground</td> <td>Same as -fg </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>-iconic</td> <td>Starts the program in a minimised form</td> </tr>
</table>
</center>

<h2> 1.3 XCombat Setup </h2>
The environment variable XCOMBAT_PATH must be set to the directory
of where the XCombat data files are stored. This is required so 
that XCombat knows where to look to find the aircraft models,
texture maps and other data required for the program to run. For example if the
xcombat data directory is located in <b>/usr/local/xcombat</b> the
command to set the environment variable would be:
<pre>
    <b>csh/tcsh:</b>   setenv XCOMBAT_PATH "/usr/local/xcombat"
    <b>zsh:</b>        XCOMBAT_PATH="/usr/local/xcombat ; export XCOMBAT_PATH 
</pre>

<h2> 1.4 Running on an X-Terminal </h2>
XCombat makes use of the OSF/Motif and the Silicon Graphics OpenGL
libraries. Therefore it is intended to run on any UNIX system which supports
X11 (X Windows), Motif and OpenGL. 
<p>
There are in fact two <i>xcombat</i> executables. One is for use on 
OpenGL capable displays and is called <i>xcombat_ogl</i> and the other
is for use on displays which do not have the GLX extensions such as
most X-Terminals and is called <i>xcombat_mgl</i>, since it is based
on the Mesa graphics library.
<p>
The file <i>xcombat</i> is a shell script which determines if the GLX 
extension is present on the user's display and calls the appropriate 
executable. The script passes all the command line arguments supplied to
the appropriate executable. This whole process should be completely 
transparent to the user. In effect there is no operational difference
for the user when running XCombat on a GLX enabled terminal or a 
standard X-Terminal.
<p>
There are however important non-functional differences in running 
the two different versions of XCombat. 
The most important difference is speed and performance. The OpenGL
version makes use of accelerated graphics hardware which results in
fast animation and a quick response time to user input. The X-Terminal
version draws the 3D graphics entirely in software and as a results is
considerably slower. 
<p>
In order to improve performance on the software based version, a number of
visual features have been disabled. None of the functionality has been 
removed. All that has been done is to modify how some of the graphics have
been drawn in order to improve the performance of the program. The changes
include:
<ul>
<li> Disabling lighting - all polygons are flat shaded.
<li> Disabling fog.
<li> Enabling dithering.
<li> Defaults to simple triangular shaped models for aircraft.
<li> Reduced colours in gui components.
</ul>
<p>
There are a number of things that the user can do to improve performance.
These include:
<ul>
<li> Resizing the window to a smaller size.
<li> Displaying only the options actually required. Turning on the radar, traces,
     and jamming for all aircraft slows the program down.
<li> Not using texture mapping.
<li> Using keyboard commands especially to transform the scene - it's faster.
</ul>
<p>
OpenGL based programs tend to make use of many colours. If the display being
used is only capable of 8-bit graphics (256 colours), it is possible to 
reduce colourmap problems by setting the environment variable MESA_RGB_VISUAL
to an appropriate visual. For example in <i>csh</i>:
<pre>
    setenv MESA_RGB_VISUAL "PseudoColor 8"
</pre>
The <i>xcombat</i> script will set this variable automatically if it has
not already being set by the user.

<h2> 1.5 Screen Layout </h2>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
The XCombat Window has two main components. Most of the window is taken up
a three dimensional OpenGL drawing area. This is the part of the window,
where the simulation is viewed and animated. Across the top length of the window,
is the menubar. The menubar contains eight menus containing various operations
which enable the user to modify how XCombat displays information in the drawing
area. The user may use various mouse and keyboard commands (described later) 
while the mouse cursor is inside the drawing area, to control how information
is displayed. The XCombat window may also be moved around the screen and resized to 
whatever size the user requires.
</td>
    <td><img src="images/xcombat.gif" align=left></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2> 1.6 Air Combat Space </h2>
The XCombat drawing area is where all the action takes place. It allows
the user to view the simulation in three dimensions from a number of
different views. In addition independent rotation, translation and scaling 
of each view is possible. Four views of the simulation are available.

<h2> 1.7 Views </h2>

XCombat provides four different ways in which a run may be viewed. These constitute
different views called Worldview, Viewpoint, Spotter, and Cockpit. Example of these
views are shown below.
<p>
<center>
<table class="table"> 
<tr>
<td> <img src="images/worldview.gif"> <br> <b> WORLDVIEW </b> </td>
<td> <img src="images/viewpoint.gif"> <br> <b> VIEWPOINT </b> </td>
<tr>

<tr>
<td> <img src="images/cockpit.gif"> <br> <b> COCKPIT </b> </td>
<td> <img src="images/spotter.gif"> <br> <b> SPOTTER </b> </td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>

<h3> 1.7.1 Worldview </h3>
The Worldview starts with a top plan view of the scenario, with the
user looking down the z axis. It is a general purpose view enabling the
user to look at the whole run from any position and angle. As it's
name suggests it is a view of the <i>whole world</i>. In the case of XCombat,
the <i>whole world</i> is the three dimensional area in which the simulation
occurs.

<h3> 1.7.2 Viewpoint </h3>
The Viewpoint is identical to the Worldview. It is provided so the user may have
two views of the simulation from two different angles. For example a user
may chose to have a top view in Worldview and a side on view in Viewpoint.

<h3> 1.7.3 Spotter </h3>
The Spotter view is a view from behind the currently selected aircraft.
This view follows the currently selected aircraft. The user may rotate
translate and scale this view. For example, by scaling out it is possible
to follow a particular aircraft and still be able to see the positions of
the other aircraft.

<h3> 1.7.4 Cockpit </h3>
The Cockpit view is a view from inside the cockpit of the currently
selected aircraft. It is also possible to perform transformations from
this view. For example by rotating 180 degrees around the z-axis, the view
is from inside the cockpit but looking back.

<h2> 1.8 Aircraft </h2>
The aircraft in the simulation are represented by three dimensional 
models which are representative of the actual shape of the real aircraft.
Aircraft models exist for the F/A-18 Hornet, F-16 Falcon, F-5, A-4 Skyhawk,
P-3 Orion, and the F-111. 

Each aircraft in the simulation is in a different colour to enable the user
to distinguish them. For example the first aircraft is green the second one is
yellow, the third one is red and so on.

<h2> 1.9 Missiles </h2>
When an aircraft launches a missile, a three dimensional model of a missile
is displayed. Missiles are coloured white except for the wings which are the 
colour of the aircraft that launched that particular missile. When a missile
is launched from the current aircraft the missile type is shown for the 
duration of the missile's flight in the information box at the bottom part 
of the screen.

<h2> 1.10 Flares </h2>
Flares are displayed at the coordinates specified in the run file when an
aircraft launches them. The symbol <b>*FLARE*</b> is displayed in the information
box if a flare is launched. The flares are coloured white.

<h2> 1.11 Radar </h2>
XCombat has the ability to display radar information for each aircraft. 
Both a radar scan volume and an instantaneous radar beam can be displayed 
for each aircraft. The scan volume and instantaneous beam can be turned
off independently for each aircraft. The radar is displayed in the colour of
the aircraft. The image below shows the scan volume and instantaneous beam
displayed for a single aircraft.
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/radar.gif">
</center>

<h2> 1.13 Electronic Warfare </h2>
XCombat can display various types of electronic warfare and radar information.
For example, an aircraft flashes white if it has been detected by enemy radar. 
The image below shows and aircraft displaying a number of different jamming symbols
around it.
<p>
<center><img src="images/ew.gif"></center>
<p>
If the aircraft is electronically jammed different symbols will appear around the aircraft. 
The following jamming types and symbology are displayed:
<ul>
<li> Barrage Jamming (Yellow Lightning Bolt from Aircraft Nose) 
<li> Smart Noise Jamming (Magenta Lightning Bolt from Aircraft Nose) 
<li> Deceptive Jamming (Red Lightning Bolt from Aircraft Nose) 
<li> Jammed Range Denial (Red Circle around aircraft and letter 'R') 
<li> Jammed Velocity Denial (Red Circle and letter 'V') 
<li> Jammed Bearing Denial (Red Circle and letter 'B') 
<li> Jammed STT Denial (Red Circle and letter 'S') 
<li> Radar Detected (Aircraft Flashes White)
<li> Aircraft Spiked (Aircraft Flashes Pink)
<li> Low Prf Mode (Letter 'L' in aircraft colour)
<li> Medium Prf Mode (Letter 'M' in aircraft colour)
<li> High Prf Mode (Letter 'H' in aircraft colour)
</ul>

<h2> 1.14 Waypoints </h2>
Waypoints that are specified in a run file can be displayed by XCombat. 
Waypoints for side 1 are in blue and waypoints for side 2 are displayed in red.
They are displayed at the coordinates specified in the run file.
There are three different types of waypoints. Therefore three different types
of symbols are used to display them.
<ul>
<li> Normal - Unfilled Circle
<li> Target - Unfilled Triangle
<li> Cap - Unfilled Square
</ul>

<h2> 1.15 Battle Box </h2>
The battle box is a rectangular wireframe box in which all the aircraft and missiles
fly inside. On the "floor" of the battle box is a grid to enable the user to track the
motion of the aircraft. 
<p>
The battle box also provides ground markers in the shape of arrows
directly below each aircraft on the ground clearly indicating the aircraft's (x,y)
position and it's direction. Height markers are also provided showing the height of each
aircraft on the battle box sides. Both the ground and height markers are in the 
colour of the aircraft which they correspond to.

<h2> 1.16 Information Screen </h2>
Along the bottom of the drawing area various information is displayed.
This includes information about the run in progress such as the total run time,
the current elapsed time and the size of the battle area. Information about the
current aircraft is also displayed such as altitude, velocity, throttle strength,
and the number of flares and missiles currently in the air.

<h2> 1.17 Object Traces </h2>
Aircraft and missile traces may be enabled to help the user track the motion 
of the aircraft. See section 2.2.1 for more information.

<h2> 1.18 Animation </h2>
One of the most useful features of XCombat is the ability to animate a run.
The animation may be started or stopped at any stage. All the functionality of
the program is still available while animating. Therefore the user for example
can turn on radar, texture mapping, object traces, waypoints or any other
feature while the animation is running.
<p> 
The speed of the animation is as fast as the CPUs and the graphics pipeline
can handle. Therefore with a low CPU load and a run with only a few aircraft, 
animation speeds between two and three times faster than real time are achievable.
These speeds correspond to 20-30 frames per second. Real time synchronisation
has not being implemented at this stage in this version of XCombat.

<h1> 2 Menu Operations </h1>

<h2> 2.1 File Menu </h2>

<h3> 2.1.1 Open </h3>
The Open menu item display a dialog box allowing the user to load a new run
file into XCombat. If the user chooses a new file from the dialog box, the current
file is discarded and the new one is loaded and most of the settings in the program 
are reset.

<h3> 2.1.2 Load Settings </h3>
The Load Settings menu item displays a dialog box to allow a user to load
a file containing saved settings for the program. Once the file is loaded
the new settings will take effect.

<h3> 2.1.3 Save Settings </h3>
The Save Settings menu item saves the current user's settings to a file
specified by the user in the dialog box. In this version of XCombat
the rotation, translation and scaling parameters for each view are the
only options saved.

<h3> 2.1.4 Exit Menu </h3>
The Exit menu item brings up a dialog box asking the user if they wish
to exit the program.

<h3> 2.2 Options Menu </h3>

<h3> 2.2.1 Object Trace </h3>
The Object Trace menu item displays a dialog box enabling the user to 
independently turn on traces for both the aircraft and the missiles. 

The missiles have a single trace coming out of the exhaust and it is the 
same colour as the aircraft that launched it
Each aircraft has two traces; one from each wingtip. The traces for both
the aircraft and the missiles can be solid or dashed lines.

The length and the frequency of the traces may also be set.

<h3> 2.2.2 Radar </h3>
The Radar menu item displays a dialog box enabling the user to display
the scan volume and/or instantaneous beam for each aircraft's radar.
The radar is of the same colour as the current aircraft and may be toggled
using the buttons in the dialog box.

<h3> 2.2.3 Display </h3>
The display menu brings up a dialog box enabling the user to display
a number of different options simply by clicking on the toggle buttons.
The user may display waypoints, electronic warfare information such
as radar detection and jamming and a head up display. The complete list
of options which the user can toggle are:
<ul>
<li> Waypoints
    <ul>
    <li> Side 1
    <li> Side 2
    </ul>
<li> Electronic Warfare
    <ul>
    <li> Jamming
    <li> Radar Detection
    <li> PRF Mode
    </ul>
<li> Body Axis Roll
<li> Head Up Display
<li> Information Box
<li> Fog and Atmospheric Effects
</ul>

<h2> 2.3 Run Menu </h2>

<h3> 2.3.1 Go/Pause </h3>
The Go/Pause menu item allows the starting and stopping of the animation.

<h3> 2.3.2 Time Step </h3>
The Time Step Menu item displays a dialog box allowing the
user to to step through the simulation in step of 
0.1, 1.0, 5.0 or 10.0 seconds either forwards or backwards. The user
may also click on the Start or the End button to go to the start or
the end of the run respectively. The current elapsed time is also displayed
in the dialog box. An image of the dialog box is shown below.
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/timestep.gif">
</center>

<h2> 2.4 Transformations Menu </h2>

<h3> 2.4.1 Rotate </h3>
The Rotate menu item displays a dialog box containing three sliders 
corresponding to the X, Y, and Z axes. Each slider allows the view to 
be rotated around the corresponding axis from 0 to 360 degrees. The current
angle is indicated on each slider. The rotation angles are independent for
each view. This means that changing the view while this dialog box is being 
displayed will changed the values of the sliders corresponding to the angles
of the new view. While the user drags the slider, the scene is automatically
updated.

<h3> 2.4.2 Translate </h3>
The Translate menu item displays a dialog box with three sliders, 
corresponding to the X, Y, and Z directions. Each slider will translate
the scene in the corresponding direction.

<h3> 2.4.3 Scale </h3>
The Scale menu item displays a dialog box containing a single slider,
which controls the scaling in the current view. Moving the slider allows
the user to zoom (scale) in or out of the current view. The scale mechanism
used depends on the current view. For example, in Worldview the slider
scales into the centre of the battle box, whereas in spotter view the centre
is the centre of the current aircraft model.

<h3> 2.5 Aircraft Menu </h3>

<h3> 2.5.1 Select </h3>
The Select menu item brings up a sub-menu displaying a list of all the aircraft
in the current run. Selecting an aircraft from the list will make that aircraft
the current aircraft and will change the view to Spotter if it is not already
in that viewing mode. If however the current view is Cockpit, XCombat will remain
in this view and simply change to the new aircraft selected.

<h3> 2.5.2 Scale </h3>
The Scale menu item brings up a sub-menu displaying a list of aircraft scale factors.
This allows the user to change the scale of the aircraft models. The default is set
to 10.0 times larger than actual size, which makes the aircraft easier to see.
Selecting a scale factor of 1.0 will rescale the aircraft to their relative actual sizes.

<h3> 2.5.3 Information </h3>
The Information menu item displays a dialog box displaying various information about 
the current aircraft such as speed, altitude, g-load, side and aircraft type.
This information is dynamically updated as the as the simulation is running.

<h2> 2.6 Graphics </h2>

<h3> 2.6.1 Aircraft Model </h3>
The Aircraft Model menu item brings up a sub-menu allowing the user to choose
between a simple or detailed aircraft model. The detailed model is representative
of the true shape of the aircraft whereas the simple model is just a triangle.
The simple model is used when a speed increase is required and the the overhead
is too computationally expensive for the detailed model. This is the case 
when running the non-GLX version of XCombat on a terminal which does not
have dedicated OpenGL graphics acceleration hardware.
The detailed model is the default for the OpenGL XCombat and the simple model 
is the default for MesaGL XCombat.

<h3> 2.6.2 World Model </h3>
The World Model menu item brings up a sub-menu allowing the user to choose
between displaying a battle box or a realistic texture mapped sky and ground.

<h2> 2.7 Help Menu </h2>

<h3> 2.7.1 Online Help </h3>
The Online Help menu item calls up the netscape program displaying 
a help file for XCombat.

<h3> 2.7.2 About </h3>
The About menu item displays a dialog providing some information about the
XCombat system.

<h1> 3 Mouse Operations </h1>
The mouse is an important user interface component of the XCombat system.
As well as allowing the user to move and resize the main window, select 
menu items and interact with dialog boxes, operations specific to XCombat
are provided when the mouse is used within the three dimensional drawing
area depending on which mouse button is used.

<h2> 3.1 Left Button </h2>
Clicking on the left mouse button inside the drawing area will start the animation. 
Clicking again will stop the animation. The left mouse button therefore acts as a toggle
enabling the user to start and stop the animation quickly and easily.

<h2> 3.2 Middle Button </h2>
Instead of using the keyboard or the rotate dialog box to rotate the current
scene, the middle mouse button may be used. To rotate the scene, click on the middle
mouse button within the drawing area and keep it held down. Move the mouse horizontally
or vertically. As the mouse moves while the middle button is being held the view
will rotate. Releasing the middle mouse button will stop the rotation.

<h2> 3.3 Right Button </h2>
The right mouse button is used for selecting aircraft. An aircraft may be made
current by placing the cursor on the aircraft and clicking on the right mouse 
button. If the current view is from the cockpit, selecting a new aircraft using
the mouse will change views to the cockpit of the new aircraft. In all other views,
selecting an aircraft will change to a spotter view of the new aircraft.
It is often difficult to pick an aircraft while it is moving using this method.
It is easier to stop the animation using the left mouse button and then use the
right mouse button to pick an aircraft.

<h1> 3.4 Keyboard Operations </h1>
XCombat has keyboard shortcuts to many commonly used operations. This allows
the user to quickly make a change to the state of the program without having
to use the mouse to look through menus and dialog boxes. The table below shows
the keyboard commands available in XCombat.
 
In order for the keyboard command to take effect, the mouse cursor must be 
inside the three dimensional drawing area of XCombat and not on a menu
or dialog box.
